1. plotting/vizulization PAUL
2. interpretation of ellipticity measure & scoring metric ALL
3. compute pointwise "haloness" based on kernel for a particular sky DAN
4. given a discrete grid of haloness values, determine location of halos;
	maybe smooth the grid of haloness values. ALEX
5. Maybe we should create a gradient ascent search where we base the gradient
        ascent on our haloness function
